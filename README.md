# Jenkins Pipeline for Terraform and GitHub Integration



Overview
This project sets up a Jenkins pipeline to automate the creation and management of AWS infrastructure using Terraform. It integrates with GitHub for source code management and includes features for manual approval before applying changes. The pipeline also generates a Terraform plan as a text artifact.

Features
Jenkins Pipeline Integration: Automates CI/CD for AWS infrastructure using Terraform.
GitHub Integration: Pulls Terraform configuration and Jenkinsfile from a GitHub repository.
Terraform S3 Backend: Configures Terraform to use an S3 backend for state management.
Terraform Plan Artifacts: Generates a text file artifact showing the Terraform plan.
Manual Approval: Includes a manual approval step before applying changes to the AWS infrastructure.
Prerequisites
Before setting up the Jenkins pipeline, ensure you have the following:

Jenkins: Installed and running.
GitHub Repository: Contains Terraform code and Jenkinsfile.
AWS Account: Necessary credentials and permissions to create AWS infrastructure.
Terraform: Installed on the Jenkins server.
AWS CLI: Installed and configured on the Jenkins server.
Setup
1. Configure GitHub Repository
Ensure your GitHub repository contains:

Terraform Code: Configuration files for your AWS infrastructure.
Jenkinsfile: Defines the Jenkins pipeline for running Terraform commands.
2. Jenkins Pipeline Configuration
Create a New Pipeline Job:

Go to Jenkins Dashboard.
Click on “New Item” and select “Pipeline.”
Name your job and click “OK.”
Configure Pipeline Script:

In the pipeline configuration, select "Pipeline script from SCM."
Choose "Git" as the SCM and enter your GitHub repository URL.
Provide credentials if required.
Set Up S3 Backend for Terraform:

Ensure your Terraform code includes configuration for S3 backend. Example configuration:

Configure Jenkinsfile:

Your Jenkinsfile should include stages for:
Checkout code from GitHub
Terraform init
Terraform plan
Manual approval
Terraform apply
Example Jenkinsfile:


3. Configure AWS Credentials in Jenkins
Go to Jenkins Dashboard.
Navigate to "Manage Jenkins" > "Manage Credentials."
Add your AWS credentials (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key).
Usage
Trigger the Pipeline:

Start the Jenkins pipeline job manually or configure a webhook in GitHub to trigger on code changes.
Monitor Pipeline Execution:

Review the pipeline stages in Jenkins.
Check the generated Terraform plan artifact under the "Artifacts" section.
Manual Approval:

During the pipeline execution, you will be prompted to approve the Terraform plan before proceeding with the application.
